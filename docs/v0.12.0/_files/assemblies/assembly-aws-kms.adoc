= Setting up AWS KMS

[role="_abstract"]
To use {aws}/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html[AWS Key Management Service] with the Record Encryption filter, use the following setup:

* Establish an AWS KMS aliasing convention for keys
* Configure the AWS KMS 
* Create AWS KMS keys

You'll need a privileged AWS user that is capable of creating users and policies to perform the set-up.
