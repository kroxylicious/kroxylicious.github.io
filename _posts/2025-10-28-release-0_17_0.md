The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release
of [Kroxylicious 0.17.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.17.0). See
the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0170) for a list of changes and
summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

The main highlights of this release are:

### Netty improvements

* Kroxylicious now depends on Netty 4.2, which brings upgrades such as making `io_uring` a first class transport and an improved memory allocator.
* We now offer some netty-specific metrics which give insights into memory allocation and executor task queues.
* Netty worker thread counts are now configurable.

### Filter Archetype

Get started with developing your own Custom Filter for Kroxylicious! You can now create a sample Filter project using a maven archetype
to get up and running quickly. The generated project demonstrates how to structure a Filter project, and shows off our powerful integration 
testing tools which can simplify testing Filters against a real Apache Kafka cluster.

Run `mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=io.kroxylicious -DarchetypeArtifactId=kroxylicious-filter-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=0.17.0`
to get started!

For a more comprehensive guide to how to work with the Filter Archetype, see the [Developer Quickstart](https://kroxylicious.io/documentation/0.17.0/html/developer-quick-start/).

### Kroxylicious 1.0.0 proposal

We are currently discussing a proposal to [release Kroxylicious 1.0.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/design/pull/82), and formalize our support policy for patch releases.
The aims are:

* Move to 1.0.0 to signal production-readiness
* Stronger API/config stability guarantees until 2.0.0
* Clear support policy for patch releases

This will provide more predictability for everyone using Kroxylicious and developing against its APIs. Your feedback is essential to get this right. Please
feel free to review and leave feedback on the proposal.
