The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the [0.15.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/releases/tag/v0.15.0) release of our Junit5 Extension.

We’ve refreshed our dependencies, including an essential upgrade to Apache Kafka 4.2.0. We’ve also smoothed out the setup process, ensuring the new Kafka Queues feature works seamlessly straight out of the box.
