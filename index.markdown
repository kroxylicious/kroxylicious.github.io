*Kroxylicious* is a project aiming to provide an open source pluggable framework for
writing network proxies that understand the Apache Kafka&#174; protocol.

<br />

#### Why?

Proxies are a powerful architectural pattern which are widely used for other
application-layer protocols, such as HTTP.

They could solve a number of problems organizations have using Kafka. While
some organizations running Apache Kafka have written Kafka-aware proxies, they have tended to
remain closed-source and do very specific things.

Kroxylicious is an early-stage project which seeks to lower the cost of developing Kafka
proxies by providing a lot of the common requirements out-of-the-box.

This lets developers focus on the logic needed to get _their_ proxy to do what
_they_ need.
