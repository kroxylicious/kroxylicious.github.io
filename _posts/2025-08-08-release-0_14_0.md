The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release
of [Kroxylicious 0.14.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.14.0). See
the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0140) for a list of changes and
summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Key Highlights

* **New Authentication APIs for Plugin Authors:**
  We are laying the groundwork for powerful client-identity-oriented Plugins. Our goal is to enable Plugins to access
  and influence client identity. This opens the door to advanced features like per-user authorization, message
  redaction, and much more!

  This release takes the first major steps by adding APIs that allow Filters to:
    - [Access client-provided TLS certificates](https://github.com/kroxylicious/design/blob/main/proposals/005-filter-api-to-expose-client-and-server-tls-info.md).
    - [Report and access SASL authentication details](https://github.com/kroxylicious/design/blob/main/proposals/006-filter-api-to-expose-client-sasl-info.md)
      across the Filter chain.

* **New Back-Pressure Metrics:**
  You can now pinpoint performance bottlenecks with new duration metrics that measure exactly how long the proxy is
  applying back-pressure to client connections.

* **Large Message Encryption Fix:**
  See you later, alligator! We've squashed a critical bug in the Record Encryption Filter where encrypting events over
  1MB would fail ([#2504](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues/2504)).

* **API Versions Negotiation Fix:**
  We resolved a bug that prevented Redpanda Connect (using the [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) client) 
  from connecting when Kroxylicious was proxying older Kafka broker versions ([#2450](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues/2450)).
