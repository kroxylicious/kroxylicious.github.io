The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release
of [Kroxylicious 0.17.1](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.17.1). See
the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0171) for a list of changes and
summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

The main highlights of this release are:

### Librdkafka compression Fix

Included in the Apache Kafka broker v4.0 was some special cases handling for deprecated versions of ProduceRequest (
versions 0 through 2), the proxy however was not relaying this customisation. This had the effect of preventing
librdkafka clients older than v2.11.0 from enabling compression when connecting via the proxy. As librdkafka supports a
wide variety of language bindings we are releasing this fix as a special patch release rather than waiting for v0.18.0.
