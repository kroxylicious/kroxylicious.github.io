The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.11.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.11.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0110) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Revamped configuration file format

The main change in this release is a revamped configuration file format.  We hope this change means that Kroxylicious is more intuitive to configure.  The changes are fully described in the [changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0110) but
to help you quickly update your configuration, compare the [new](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/refs/tags/v0.11.0/kroxylicious-app/example-proxy-config.yaml) and [old](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/refs/tags/v0.10.0/kroxylicious-app/example-proxy-config.yaml) configurations.

Backward compatibility has been maintained with the old format, so your old configuration will keep working for the next few releases. You'll see deprecation warnings in the logs during startup. 

### New policy to control record encryption's behaviour when a KEK doesn't resolve

We've added a new feature that lets you define Record Encryption's behaviour when it cannot resolve a key encryption key (KEK) for a topic. You can now choose to have the Record Encrypton filter reject the producer batch so that the application will see errors,
rather than letting the records through unencrypted.  The default behaviour is unchanged.

### Feedback

Please let us know, through [Slack](https://kroxylicious.slack.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues) or even [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/kroxylicious.io)), if you find the project interesting or helpful and especially if you have deployed it in production.
