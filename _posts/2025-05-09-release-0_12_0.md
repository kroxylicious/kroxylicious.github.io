The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.12.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.12.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0120) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Apache Kafka 4.0.0 compatibility

The main change in this release is Apache Kafka 4.0.0 compatibility.  The proxy will now relay Kafka 4.0 specific versions of the Kafka RPC and your filters can intercept them.

### Downstream mTLS now defaults to REQUIRE

If you are using TLS client authentication (in other words , mutual TLS) between Kafka Clients and the Proxy, the Proxy will now default to requiring that client present a certificate - `REQUIRE` mode - rather than `NONE` (as was previously the case).  If the client does not
present a certificate that is trusted by the trust-anchor, the connection will fail to be established.  The motivation for this change is adhering to the "Secure by Default" philosophy.
