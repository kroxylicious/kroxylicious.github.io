The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.4.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

The big news is this release includes our `EnvelopeEncryption` filter which provides an **Encryption-at-Rest** solution for the Apache Kafka(tm) which is _transparent_ to both clients and brokers. We have more work planned to iterate on the implentation to reach production quality. Checkout our [0.5.0 milestone](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/milestones/0.5.0) for details.

The `EnvelopeEncryption` filter works by intercepting all produce requests from applications and applies encryption to the kafka records as they pass through Kroxylicious. On the consume path, the reverse happens - the filter intercepts the fetch responses and decrypts the records before they are sent to the application.

The Kafka Cluster *never* sees the plain text of your records. Filter configuration is used to specify which topic(s) should be encrypted by which key.

The encryption keys themselves are stored safely in a Key Management System.  0.4.0 ships with an integration with [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)(tm).  We will provide other selected Key Management System integrations soon, however we are also leveraging our plug-in architecture to allow users to supply their own integrations.

The diagram below shows how the system works at a high level.

If the use-case interest you, there are some resources (TODO: link) to help you try out the feature in development.  There will be more information landing on the website soon, but in the meanwhile if you have questions or comments please head over to the [Slack channel](https://kroxylicious.slack.com/).

The 0.4.0 release also ships binary artefacts for the first time.  You'll find these on the GitHub (release page)[https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.4.0], and available through [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-app/0.4.0/).
