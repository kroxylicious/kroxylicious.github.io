The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the [0.12.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/releases/tag/v0.12.0) release of our Junit5 Extension. This release introduces support for Apache Kafka 4.1, removes the deprecated `@SaslPlainAuth` annotation and enables Users to customize the names of topics automatically created by the extension.

Support for earlier versions of Kafka is maintained, including versions that require Zookeeper. Just put the version of Kafka you want to use on the classpath - and everything else is automatic.
