The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.18.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.18.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0180) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

The main highlights of this release are:

### Filter API Improvements

* Filters now have a convenient mechanism to convert from topic ids [KIP-516](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-516%3A+Topic+Identifiers) to topic names this is based on [design proposal#008](https://github.com/kroxylicious/design/blob/main/proposals/008-topic-name-lookup-facility.md)
* Filters now have access to a Subject API that provides convenient access to the authenticated principals established by the channel. This is a building block for filters that need to enforce authorization checks or want to write an audit trail of Kafka actions. Further details and context can be found
  in [design proposal#009](https://github.com/kroxylicious/design/blob/main/proposals/009-authorizer.md)

### Authorizer Filter

We've added a new Authorizer Filter that can authorize Topic operations using the same semantics as Kafka own Authorization API. This allows you to enforce authorizations rules at the proxy.

### Azure KMS integration for Record Encryption

With this release, Record Encryption now has the capability to use Azure Vault for storage of the key material used to encrypt Kafka records.
