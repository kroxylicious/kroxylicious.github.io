The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the [0.14.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/releases/tag/v0.14.0) release of our Junit5 Extension.

The main change in this release is the upgrade of [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) dependency from 1.x to 2.x.
The Junit 5 Extension uses Testcontainers to create broker instances for your Junit tests (when you choose [container-based provisioning](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/blob/v0.14.0/README.md#choosing-the-provisioning-mechanism)).
As a user of the Junit 5 Extension, the changes should be completely transparent to you.

### Feedback

Please let us know, through [Slack](https://kroxylicious.slack.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/issues), if you find the extension interesting or helpful.
