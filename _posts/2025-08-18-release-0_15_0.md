The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release
of [Kroxylicious 0.15.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.15.0). See
the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0150) for a list of changes and
summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

This is a critical feature release, fast-tracked to address a key resilience issue for our users.

### Key Highlights

* **Improved Bootstrap Resilience and Load Distribution:**
    Previously, when presented with a list of `bootstrapServers`, the proxy would only ever attempt to bootstrap connections using the first address in the list. This concentrated the bootstrapping load and created a single point of failure. See [#1870](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues/1870).

    To improve resilience, we have changed the default behaviour to **round-robin** over the supplied `bootstrapServers` each time the proxy receives a new connection from a client. This spreads the load and protects against an extended outage of the primary bootstrap address. For more control, you can now configure the selection strategy to be either `round-robin` or `random`. See the [documentation](https://kroxylicious.io/documentation/0.15.0/html/kroxylicious-proxy/#ref-configuring-proxy-example-proxy) for an example configuration. 

    Big thank you to [The-East-Wind](https://github.com/The-East-Wind) and [opan](https://github.com/opan) for contributing towards the solution.

* **New Quickstart Guide: Record Encryption on Kubernetes:**
    Looking for an encryption-at-rest solution for data stored in your Apache Kafka? We've got you covered!

    This release includes a [brand-new quickstart guide](https://kroxylicious.io/documentation/0.15.0/html/record-encryption-quickstart/) that will show you how to implement record encryption on Kubernetes from scratch, with no external dependencies. Youâ€™ll be encrypting in a snap!
