      <h2>Backports, CVEs, and respins, oh my!</h2>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <strong>Found an undisclosed vulnerability?</strong> Please follow our <a href="https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/security/policy">security disclosure policy</a> rather than raising it publicly. The process below is for backporting CVEs that are already public.
      </div>
      <p>Kroxylicious is a community endeavour: we maintain one branch, <code>main</code>, and make releases from it.
      We always recommend running the latest release.</p>
      <p>We recognise this doesn't work for everyone. The community can get fixes into older releases — with a little help from a friend.</p>

      <p>A note on <strong>respins</strong>: a CVE in a base image alone is not a reason to cut a maintenance release — rebuild your container image instead.
      Maintenance releases are for vulnerabilities in Kroxylicious code or its runtime dependencies.</p>

      <h3>How to get a maintenance release</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start a conversation</strong> — anyone in the community, including committers and project managers, needs to drop a note to <a href="mailto:kroxylicious-dev@googlegroups.com">kroxylicious-dev@googlegroups.com</a> describing the version you need and the fixes required.
        This is a discussion, not a demand: you'll need to convince a committer that a maintenance release makes sense.</li>
        <li><strong>A committer creates the release branch</strong> — if a committer agrees, they will create a <code>release/X.Y</code> branch.
        Community members cannot create release branches directly; this step requires a committer.</li>
        <li><strong>The community does the work</strong> — cherry-picks from <code>main</code> are ideal, but not always practical.
        Were <code>main</code> ever to move to a new major version of a core dependency, an older release on the previous version would need changes adapted rather than simply cherry-picked.
        The contributor proposing the backport is responsible for that adaptation.</li>
        <li><strong>Agree scope</strong> — before cutting the maintenance release, the committer should call for lazy consensus on the mailing list: share what will be included and allow a reasonable window for objections.
        There's no value in running the release machinery for every individual change; batching is preferred.
        For a highly exploitable CVE the committers may agree to shorten or waive the consensus window.</li>
        <li><strong>A committer cuts the release</strong> — once consensus is reached, lazy style, on the branch content, a committer will cut the release.</li>
      </ol>
