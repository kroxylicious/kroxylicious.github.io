The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.11.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.11.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0110) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Refreshed configuration file format

The main change in this release is a revamped configuration file format.  We hope this change means that Kroxylicious is more intuative to configure.   As always, backward compatibility has been maintained with the old format, but you'll see deprecation
warnings in the logs.  See the [changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0110) for details of what you'll need to change.

### Policy allows you to define behaviour when the key encryption key (KEK) doesn't resolve

We've added a new feature that lets you define the behaviour when a Record Encryption cannot resolve a KEK for a topic.  You can now choose to have the Record Encrypton filter reject the producer batch so that the application will see errors,
rather than letting the records through unencrypted.

### Feedback

Please let us know, through [Slack](https://kroxylicious.slack.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues) or even [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/kroxylicious.io)), if you find the project interesting or helpful and especially if you have deployed it in production.
