The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.7.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.7.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#070) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Record Validation 

In this release, Kroxylicious dips its toes (or, should that be claws?) into the world of record validation. You can now ensure that the content your producers send adheres to the schema you expect. If a producer sends
a record that doesn't meet the expected schema, the producer will get an error response and the message won't be delivered to the topic. Banish those poison messages from your topics for good!
Read more about the [use-case](https://kroxylicious.io/use-cases/#schema-validation-and-enforcement) or dive right into the [documentation](https://kroxylicious.io/docs/v0.7.0/#assembly-record-validation-filter-proxy).
This is a preview feature and we are already thinking about enhancements. We'd love to hear your feedback. Thanks to [Carles Arnal](https://github.com/carlesarnal) of the [Apicurio project](https://www.apicur.io/) for all the
work he put into this feature.

### Record Encryption plays nicely with Bouncy Castle

We had a request from the community to tweak how record encryption resolves its keys so that it was compatible with the [FIPS certified](https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation/documentation-java/#bouncy-castle-java-fips-documentation) JCE provider [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/). 

### Artefacts

You'll find binaries attached to the GitHub [release](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.7.0), and available through [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-app/0.7.0/).

Docker images are hosted at [quay.io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious](https://quay.io/repository/kroxylicious/kroxylicious)
