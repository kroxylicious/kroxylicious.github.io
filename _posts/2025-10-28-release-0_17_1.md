The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release
of [Kroxylicious 0.17.1](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.17.1). See
the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0171) for a list of changes and
summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

The main highlights of this release are:

### Librdkafka compression Fix

This patch addresses an issue where the proxy failed to relay special handling logic introduced in Apache Kafka broker v4.0. This logic is required for deprecated ProduceRequest versions (v0-v2).

The bug prevented librdkafka clients older than v2.11.0 from enabling compression when connecting through the proxy. As librdkafka supports a wide variety of language bindings we are releasing this fix as a special patch release rather than waiting for v0.18.0.
