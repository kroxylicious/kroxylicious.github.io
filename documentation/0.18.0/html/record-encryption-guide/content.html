    <div class="paragraph _abstract">
     <p>This guide covers using the <strong>Kroxylicious Record Encryption Filter</strong> to provide encryption-at-rest for Apache Kafka. Refer to other Kroxylicious guides for information on running the proxy or for advanced topics such as plugin development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph _abstract">
     <p>The Kroxylicious Record Encryption filter enhances the security of Kafka messages. The filter uses industry-standard cryptographic techniques to apply encryption to Kafka messages, ensuring the confidentiality of data stored in the Kafka Cluster. By centralizing topic-level encryption, Kroxylicious provides streamlined protection across Kafka clusters.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>To use the filter, follow these steps:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="olist arabic">
     <ol class="arabic">
      <li>
       <p>Set up a Key Management System (KMS)</p>

     <p>The Record Encryption filter uses envelope encryption to encrypt records with symmetric encryption keys. The filter encrypts records from produce requests and decrypts records from fetch responses.</p>

       <p>Envelope encryption is an industry-standard technique suited for encrypting large volumes of data in an efficient manner. Data is encrypted with a Data Encryption Key (DEK).

     <h3 id="how_the_filter_uses_the_kms">1.3. How the filter uses the KMS</h3>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>To support the filter, the KMS provides the following:</p>
     </div>
     <div class="ulist">
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>A secure repository for storing Key Encryption Keys (KEKs)</p>

     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>KEKs stay within the KMS. The KMS generates a DEK (which is securely generated random data) for a given KEK, then returns the DEK and an encrypted DEK. The encrypted DEK has the same data but encrypted with the KEK. The KMS doesn’t store encrypted DEKs; they are stored as part of the cipher record in the broker.</p>

     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Key rotation involves periodically replacing cryptographic keys with new ones and is considered a best practice in cryptography.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The filter allows the rotation of Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) within the Key Management System (KMS). When a KEK is rotated, the new key material is eventually used for newly produced records. Existing records, encrypted with older KEK versions, remain decryptable as long as the previous KEK versions are still available in the KMS.</p>

       </tbody>
      </table>
     </div>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When the KEK is rotated in the external KMS, it will take up to 1 hour (by default) before all records produced by the filter contain a DEK encrypted with the new key material. This is because existing encrypted DEKs are used for a configurable amount of time after creation, the Filter caches the encrypted DEK, one hour after creation they are eligible to be refreshed.</p>

     <div class="paragraph _abstract">
      <p>This section describes how to recover or mitigate the loss of a Key Encryption Key (KEK) required for decryption.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A KEK is considered lost if it is no longer usable for decryption even though the Key Management System (KMS) remains accessible to the proxy. For example, the key might be scheduled for deletion or in an invalid state.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="admonitionblock warning">
      <table>
       <tbody>
        <tr>
         <td class="icon"><i class="fa icon-warning" title="Warning"></i></td>
         <td class="content">Do not delete KEKs from your KMS. Determining which KEKs are still required for decryption is complex and error-prone. If a KEK is deleted while encrypted records still depend on it, those records become unrecoverable. As a result, consuming applications will encounter errors and stop processing unless additional action is taken. <strong>Only follow the procedures in this section if absolutely necessary.</strong></td>

      </table>
     </div>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When a consumer attempts to fetch a record that cannot be decrypted, the proxy returns an error. The exact error depends on the Kafka client library:</p>
     </div>
     <div class="dlist">
      <dl>
       <dt class="hdlist1">Apache Kafka client</dt>
       <dd>
        <p><code>Unexpected error code 91 while fetching at offset n from topic-partition &lt;topic&gt;-&lt;partition&gt;</code></p>
       </dd>
       <dt class="hdlist1">librdkafka-based client</dt>
       <dd>
        <p><code>Fetch from broker 0 failed at offset n (leader epoch 0): Broker: Request illegally referred to resource that does not exist</code></p>
       </dd>
      </dl>
     </div>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>These errors indicate that the KEK required for decryption is missing. Error code 91 (<code>RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND</code>) is returned by the Record Encryption filter when the KEK is unavailable.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>To confirm the issue, check the proxy logs for entries like the following:</p>
     </div>
     <div class="listingblock">
      <div class="content">
       <pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code>Failed to decrypt record in topic-partition &lt;topic&gt;-&lt;partition&gt; owing to key not found condition.
This will be reported to the client as a RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND(91).
Client may see a message like 'Unexpected error code 91 while fetching at offset' (java) or or 'Request illegally referred to resource that does not exist' (librdkafka).

     <div class="paragraph">
      <p>If you confirm that a KEK is lost, take one of the following actions:</p>

     <div class="ulist">
      <ul>

        <p>Cancel key deletion</p>

      <div class="olist arabic">
       <ol class="arabic">
        <li>
         <p>Identify the earliest offset after which all records can be successfully decrypted.</p>
         <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Proxy instances may not switch to a new KEK at the same time, so records encrypted with different keys might appear together in the log. As a result, there may be no single offset where encryption clearly transitions from one KEK to the next.</p>

         <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Use <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code> with a binary search approach to find the lowest offset for each affected topic partition where decryption succeeds. Domain-specific knowledge can help narrow the search.</p>

        <li>
         <p>Use the new starting offset for each affected topic partition to do one of the following:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>Delete records using <code>kafka-delete-records.sh</code>

           <li>
            <p>Advance consumer group offsets using <code>kafka-consumer-groups.sh</code>

             You must reset offsets for <strong>every</strong> consumer group that must skip the records that cannot be decrypted.</p>
