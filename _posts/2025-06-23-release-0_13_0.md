The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the release of [Kroxylicious 0.13.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/releases/tag/v0.13.0). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0130) for a list of changes and summary of Deprecations, Changes and Removals.

### Kroxylicious Operator!

The team has been beavering away in the background (well we are open source, so it's been in the foreground too) to build an Operator for deploying and managing Kroxylicious in a Kubernetes environment! We think this an important step forward in simplifying the operation of the Kroxylicious proxy. We still believe the proxy works well as a standalone process and continue to support deployments in doing so, however Kubernetes makes for an interesting deployment environment where some additional automation is both possible and helpful.

There are proper descriptions of the various custom resources the operator supports in our docs but that can all be quite abstract, so to get a better feel of how to use the operator to manage specific use cases please see [our examples](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/tree/main/kroxylicious-operator/packaging/examples) which will also be included in the release artifact. 

### Monitoring the proxy

Great so you've deployed our proxy service, now how do you know its working? Until the 0.13.0 release our observability story was rather under-developed, so 0.13.0 brings a re-think of our metrics, what they mean and what they are tagged with. For the full details see the [design proposal](https://github.com/kroxylicious/design/blob/main/proposals/003-metric-improvements.md).  

### Feedback

Please let us know, through [Slack](https://kroxylicious.slack.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues) or even [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/kroxylicious.io)), if you find the project interesting or helpful and especially if you have deployed it in production.
