### Fortanix DSM KMS for Record Encryption

This release introduces initial support for using [Fortanix Data Security Manager](https://www.fortanix.com/platform/data-security-manager) as a Key Management System provider within the Kroxylicious Record Encryption filter ([#1672](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/1672)).

Fortanix and Data Security Manager are trademarks of Fortanix, Inc.

### Improvements and tweaks to Record Encryption

We've introduced some changes in this release to Encryption DEK invalidation logic to improve coordination between threads ([#1643](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/1643)), and added the ability to restrict which TLS protocols/cipher suites are available for Kafka connections (upstream and downstream) as well as the TLS connections made to KMS providers ([#1743](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/1743).

### More configurability for SNI

This release introduces the `advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` property for Server Name Indication (SNI) routing proxy configurations, allowing greater customisation for proxies using SNI ([#1761](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/1761)).
